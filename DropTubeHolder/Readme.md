This model is designed to work with a M6 sized bicycle seat post quick release.  The distance between clamping surfaces is 23mm so please keep that in mind when selecting your quick release.  This is what I used but there are many like them.

The bit at the top of the clamping section is designed to be connected. This directs the force to close the gap below, minimizing the amount of bowing in the sides and reducing the required clamping force directly against the joint.
